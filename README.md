Mini-Project A
----
Overview:
----
The objective for this project is to design an environment logger (IoT device).
This project examines ELO5.2, which requires the student to develop a representative
embedded system. It requires hardware/software interfacing, so an ADC is sampled by
software, and processing operations are applied to read the data.

Run program:
----
```sh
$ chmod +x MiniProjectA.py
$ sudo python MiniProjectA.py
```

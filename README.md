Mini-Project A
----
Overview:
----
The objective for this project is to design an environment logger (IoT device). It requires hardware/software interfacing, so an ADC is sampled by software, and processing operations are applied to read the data. The project will require use of a single Raspberry Pi, which relays data to and is controlled via an app on your phone created through Blynk.

Run program:
----
```sh
$ chmod +x MiniProjectA.py
$ sudo python MiniProjectA.py
```
